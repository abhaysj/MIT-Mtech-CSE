Certainly! Let's extend the amortized analysis to include the `FIND_MINIMUM_KEY` operation as well.

### Amortized Analysis including `FIND_MINIMUM_KEY` Operation:

#### Aggregate Analysis:

1. **Node Creation (`CREATE_NODE`)**
   - Cost: O(1) for creating a new node.

2. **HEAP_INSERT**:
   - Creating a node: O(1)
   - Union operation: O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the heap (worst-case union time for two Fibonacci heaps)
   - Overall, the time complexity of HEAP_INSERT is O(log n).

3. **HEAP_UNION**:
   - Merging heaps: O(1) since it's a constant-time operation.

4. **HEAP_MERGE**:
   - Merging heaps: O(1) since it's a constant-time operation.

5. **HEAP_LINK**:
   - Linking nodes: O(1) since it's a constant-time operation.

6. **DISPLAY**:
   - Printing a node: O(1) for each node.

7. **FIND_MINIMUM_KEY**:
   - Traversing the sibling list: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the sibling list.

#### Accounting Method:

In the accounting method, we assign an amortized cost to each operation, and the actual cost may be more or less than the amortized cost. We maintain a credit (or "potential") that can be used to pay for expensive operations.

In this case, we can assign a cost of O(log n) for each `HEAP_INSERT` operation to account for the union operation. Additionally, we'll assign a cost of O(1) for each `FIND_MINIMUM_KEY` operation.

#### Potential Method:

In the potential method, we define a potential function that represents the "extra work" done during an operation. The potential function φ is assigned to the data structure state, and the change in potential (Δφ) represents the amortized cost.

Let's define the potential function φ for this data structure:
- φ(H) = 2 * the number of trees in the Binomial heap H + 1 * the number of nodes in the sibling list of the root node

Using this potential function, we can show that the amortized cost of each `HEAP_INSERT` operation is O(log n), and the amortized cost of each `FIND_MINIMUM_KEY` operation is O(1).

#### Updated `main` Function:

```c
int main()
{
    // ... (rest of the code)

    // Assume n operations (insertions in this case)
    int num_operations = log2(n); // Number of insertions

    // Calculate amortized cost using different methods for HEAP_INSERT
    double amortized_cost_aggregate_insert = (double)(num_operations * log2(num_operations));
    double amortized_cost_amortized_insert = (double)num_operations * log2(num_operations);
    double amortized_cost_potential_insert = (double)num_operations + (2 * num_operations);

    // Calculate amortized cost using different methods for FIND_MINIMUM_KEY
    double amortized_cost_aggregate_findmin = (double)n; // Traversing the sibling list
    double amortized_cost_amortized_findmin = (double)n; // Traversing the sibling list
    double amortized_cost_potential_findmin = (double)n; // Traversing the sibling list

    printf("\nAmortized Cost (Aggregate Method) for INSERT: %.2f\n", amortized_cost_aggregate_insert);
    printf("Amortized Cost (Amortized Method) for INSERT: %.2f\n", amortized_cost_amortized_insert);
    printf("Amortized Cost (Potential Method) for INSERT: %.2f\n", amortized_cost_potential_insert);

    printf("\nAmortized Cost (Aggregate Method) for FIND_MINIMUM_KEY: %.2f\n", amortized_cost_aggregate_findmin);
    printf("Amortized Cost (Amortized Method) for FIND_MINIMUM_KEY: %.2f\n", amortized_cost_amortized_findmin);
    printf("Amortized Cost (Potential Method) for FIND_MINIMUM_KEY: %.2f\n", amortized_cost_potential_findmin);

    return 0;
}
```

In this updated `main` function, we calculate the amortized cost using different methods for both `HEAP_INSERT` and `FIND_MINIMUM_KEY` operations. We consider the traversal of the sibling list in `FIND_MINIMUM_KEY` for the aggregate analysis.
